# Infrr

## PROJECT SUMMARY

Infrr's ShoppingCart.

NOTE to hiring manager. I had to use a css framework to get an "checkout cart icon" for the header. Beside that, all CSS were written by me.

## React-Redux's architecture

Data flows from API into Components level, and vice-versa.

**API -> thunk/middleware -> rootReducer -> container -> page -> component**
