# Infrr's ShoppingCart

## PROJECT SUMMARY

Infrr's ShoppingCart.

NOTE to hiring manager. I had to use a css framework to get an "checkout cart icon" for the header. Beside that, all CSS were written by me.

## React-Redux's architecture

ðŸ’  How data flows from **afero-client**'s API into Component-level. It is essential that you understand how the data are flowing from thunk/middleware into Components level, and how date are updated at the Component level or container level

**thunk/middleware -> rootReducer -> container -> page -> component**
